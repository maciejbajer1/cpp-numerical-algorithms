# cpp-numerical-algorithms
This repository contains a set of academic tasks and implementations of classic numerical methods in C++. The focus is on solving equations, interpolation, automatic differentiation, and iterative algorithms for linear systems. Each task is implemented as a standalone module with a clean and readable codebase.
